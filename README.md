This consists of the following works:
* Creating a classification model using a Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
* A sample neural net with a 1 hidde layer that is used for a image classification problem
* A deep neural net with multiple hidden layers that has better accuracy when compared to above problems

Concepts covered are:
* Initialization of the Weights and biases
* Forward Propagation: Linear and Activation using different activation functions
* Backward Propagation: derivatives using the cache
* Compute Cost: uses the loss function to come up with the cost
* Updating the parameters: leverages the learning rate too
* Predict using the model
* Cost Optimization Analysis
